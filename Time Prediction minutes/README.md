Problem Description

In social science research, census data plays a pivotal role in the examination of inequalities related to income, employment, education, housing, and various other aspects of life. These in-depth analyses naturally lead to discussions about potential bias in categorization within these fields. Census data, therefore, serves as a valuable resource for practical investigations into the fairness of algorithms.

In this project, the primary objective is to predict the commute time to work for each individual by leveraging comprehensive census data. This study offers the potential to gain a deeper understanding of socioeconomic disparities and provides essential insights to inform evidence-based policy decisions.
